subtitle: Amateur programamer and software enthusiast

My name is José Simán. I love programming:

- I know some css, javascript, php, html, sql, vbscript, etc.
- I think Amazon's success lies in its software.
- I think the look and feel and its ease of use are key to any software's success.

What else do you need?
