I have had many ideas for programs that could be helpful to me and perhaps to other people.  My problem, I am too lazy to begin any of them.  I guess if I would monetize from them or I knew there would be many users interested in my apps, I would go ahead and venture with any of them.  On the other hand, I am not a full-time programmer, as manager of a pharmacy chain, my current work life takes all my attention and my only time to learn new languages and venture in new projects is when I am at home and the kids are asleep. 

I wish I could find someone else with whom to share these ideas and perhaps trust this one person he/she won't steal them for profit.  Instead, I would like to find a partner to start any of them and have a relationship where we can learn from each other and have fun doing so.
