title: Attempt to Predict the Devaluation of the Lempira
subtitle: Experimenting with Excel's Forecast Function, by José Simán
---

Last year, 2015, I gathered the exchange rate for every day of the Honduran Lempira in order to monitor and make better investment decisions for 2016.

Today, I decided to work with the data, nothing complicated, simply plug-in the numbers into Excel's forecast function.  If this function is used with all of 2015 and 2016 data up until today, the devaluation rate of the Honduran Lempira will be 5.9% by December 31, 2016.  This is a higher value than last year's devaluation rate of around 3.9%.

What is worrisome is that if you use less data, I mean, the data from only the past two and a half months, the devaluation rate by December 31 of 2016 could be higher, around 8.5%

This is the data file I used: [Forecast Devaluacion HN 2016](../files/Forecast_Devaluacion_HN_2016.xlsx)
